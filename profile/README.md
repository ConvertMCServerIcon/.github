# ConvertMCServerIcon

ConvertMCServerIcon is a web service that allows Minecraft server owners to easily convert their images into the correct format for Minecraft server icons. Simply upload your image, and the service will convert it into a 64x64 PNG file, ready for use as your server's icon. The service then provides the image directly with the correct name, making it easy to download and upload to your server without any extra steps.
